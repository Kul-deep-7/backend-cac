/*
This function does three critical jobs:

1️⃣ Takes a locally saved file (from Multer)
2️⃣ Uploads it to Cloudinary
3️⃣ Deletes the local copy (success OR failure)

Your server stays clean. Your media lives in the cloud

Cloudinary Utility (File Upload Helper)

What is this utility?
The Cloudinary utility is a reusable helper function that uploads files from the server to Cloudinary cloud storage and then deletes the local temporary file.
It is used when files are first stored temporarily on the backend (usually by Multer).

Why do we need a Cloudinary utility?
When a user uploads a file:
Frontend sends the file
Backend (Multer) saves it temporarily on the server
File must be moved to cloud storage
Temporary server file must be deleted
This utility automates steps 3 and 4.

What problem does it solve?
• Prevents server storage from filling up
• Centralizes upload logic in one place
• Makes file uploads reusable across projects
• Keeps controllers clean
